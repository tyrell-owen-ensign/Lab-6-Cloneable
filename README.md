This repository has all of the base files for Lab 6: Drawing things (that's not it's actual name, but that's the title I'm using here).

To use this, the best solution that I can think of is to download the files for this project in a .zip folder and then open that in your IDE.
   -> (You could technically clone and push to this repo but since It's under my account it might look sus when it actually isn't, so that's not recommended, but I'll be letting Brother Light know that I've shared this with you)

Just go to "Code">>"Download ZIP"
- Then extract the zip and open your newly extracted folder in your IDE.

- The assignment can either be submitted via github link or through uploading your files so creating a new github repository is optional.


I hope this all made enough sense. Happy coding :)
